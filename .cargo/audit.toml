# Ignore RSA vulnerability in sqlx-mysql since we only use PostgreSQL backend
# The vulnerable code path in RSA crate is not executed in our application
# 
# Context: sqlx-macros-core pulls in all database backends (mysql, postgres, sqlite)
# at compile-time for its procedural macros. We use default-features = false
# with explicit features = ["postgres", "macros", "migrate", ...] but the macros
# feature still transitively depends on sqlx-mysql which brings in the rsa crate.
# 
# Risk assessment: The RSA vulnerability (Marvin timing attack) only affects
# MySQL authentication at runtime. Our application exclusively uses PostgreSQL
# and never executes the MySQL code path.
